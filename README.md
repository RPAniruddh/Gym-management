# Gym Management Microservices Project
## Project Status
- This project is ongoing and under active development.

## Microservices Architecture
#### 1. Authentication Service
- Responsible for user management and security
- Handles user registration, login, and role-based access control
- Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication

#### 2. Member Management Service
- Manages member-related operations
- Handles member profiles, subscriptions, and membership details

#### 3. Booking and Scheduling Service
- Manages class bookings, trainer schedules, and facility reservations

#### 4. Payment Service
- Handles membership payments, billing, and financial transactions

#### 5. Fitness Tracking Service
- Manages member fitness progress, workout logs, and performance tracking

## Use Cases in Detail

#### Authentication Service Use Cases
1. User Registration
   - Allow new users (members, staff, trainers) to create accounts
   - Validate user information
   - Assign appropriate roles (MEMBER, TRAINER, ADMIN)

2. Authentication and Authorization
   - Implement login mechanism
   - Generate and validate JWT tokens
   - Role-based access control
   - Support password reset and account recovery

3. User Profile Management
   - Update user details
   - Change passwords
   - Manage account settings

#### Member Management Service Use Cases
1. Member Registration
   - Create new member profiles
   - Capture personal information
   - Select membership plans

2. Membership Management
   - View and update membership details
   - Track membership status (active, expired, pending)
   - Handle membership renewals and upgrades

3. Member Progress Tracking
   - Store and retrieve member fitness goals
   - Track body measurements
   - Record fitness assessments

#### Booking and Scheduling Service Use Cases
1. Class Booking
   - Browse available fitness classes
   - Book and cancel class reservations
   - Manage waitlists for popular classes

2. Trainer Schedule Management

   - Track sets, reps, weights
   - Store progress over time

2. Performance Analytics
   - Generate fitness progress reports
   - Compare performance across different periods
   - Provide visual fitness trend charts

## Technical Considerations
- Use Spring Boot for microservices
- Implement service discovery with Eureka
- Use API Gateway for routing
- Use MySQL for primary database
- Implement distributed tracing with Zipkin
- Use Docker for containerization

## Security Best Practices
- Implement OAuth2 for authentication
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement input validation
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
